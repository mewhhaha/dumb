## [0.0.11] - 2023-03-04

```tsx

```

- Changed `callable` to not take `Request` as its first argument

```tsx
class DurableObjectExample extends CallableDurableObject {
  @callable
  helloWorld(name: string) {
    return respond(`Hello world, ${name}!`);
  }
}
```

## [0.0.10] - 2023-03-02

### Fixed

- Fixed `Record<_,_>` type not being serialized properly

## [0.0.9] - 2023-02-25

## [0.0.8] - 2023-02-20

### Fixed

- Fixed `CHANGELOG.md` dates accidentally saying `2022` instead of `2023`.

### Removed

- Removed constructor setting `state` and `env` for `CallableDurableObject`.

## [0.0.7] - 2023-02-12

### Removed

- Removed `ws` function. It is moved to the `dumb-durable-websocket` package.

### Changed

- Changed path for callable objects to be under `/__dumb__/` to allow for other custom methods to be called.

## [0.0.6] - 2023-01-29

### Changed

- Changed canonical missing value for `value` and `error` from `undefined` to `null` so that the pattern can more reasily be replicated in other parts where there is a serialization boundary.

## [0.0.5] - 2023-01-28

### Changed

- Changed error value to reside in error, and instead have the undefined be the canonical value for success.

```tsx
const [value, error] = c.helloWorld("MY NAME");
if (error) {
  // value is undefined here
  // error has status + any value that was passed on in {Â value }
} else {
  // value is successful value here
  // error is undefined
}
```

## [0.0.4] - 2023-01-27

### Changed

- Changed result to be of a tuple of `[VALUE, ERROR]` instead of the previous object variant.

```tsx
// This allows you to quickly rename the value instead of having to do `{ value: name }`
const [value] = c.helloWorld("MY NAME");

// TypeScript is smart enough that when we check error, we can also validate what value is
const [value, error] = c.helloWorld("MY NAME");
if (error) {
  // value is error value here
} else {
  // value is successful value here
}
```

- Changed error be more opaque with the type `ResultError` which is an interface. Previously the return type would blow up because of all the HTTP status codes that were possible.

## [0.0.3] - 2023-01-27

### Fixed

- Fixed title in `README.md` to match package name.
- Fixed `CHANGELOG.md` formatting to prefix with `Added`, `Changed` and so on.
- Fixed `CHANGELOG.md` to have proper punctuation for list items.

### Changed

- Changed `typescript` to be of version `5.0.0`

### Added

- Added type called `Callable` that has the function signature which is required for class functions to match in order for the client to pick them up
- Added decorator called `@callable` that you can use to ensure the type signature of your function is correct.

```tsx
class DurableObjectExample extends CallableDurableObject {
  @callable // Decorator that ensures the type signature required for it to be callable
  helloWorld(_: Request, name: string) {
    if (name === "") {
      return error(422, { message: "Your name was empty!" });
    }
    return respond(`Hello world, ${name}!`);
  }
}
```

## [0.0.2] - 2023-01-26

### Added

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` to track changes over time.
- Added fields `repository`, `bugs` and `engines` to `package.json`.

## [0.0.1] - 2023-01-22

### Added

- Added class `CallableDurableObject` which can be derived from .
- Added type `DurableObjectNamespaceIs<...>` which can be used to type a specific namespace from an object.
- Added `client` function which can be used to create a client from a given `DurableObjectNamespaceIs<...>` to access the methods on the corresponding `CallableDurableObject`.
- Added `ws` function which has some helper functions for setting up `WebSocket`s in a `DurableObject`.
